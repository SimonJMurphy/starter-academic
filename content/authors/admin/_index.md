Simon Murphy is a postdoctoral researcher in asteroseismology (stellar pulsations) at the University of Sydney. His research interests include pulsating A/F (delta Scuti) stars, chemically peculiar (especially lambda Bootis) stars, and binary stars. He uses pulsation timing to find and parametrise binary systems. He also uses stellar pulsations to characterise stellar masses, ages and metallicities.

Simon is also an outdoors enthusiast, participating in many adventure sports and activites.
